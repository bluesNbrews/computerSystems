## CSCI 6011 (Computer Systems - simple C programs)

### arrayDiff.c 

Simple program to find the largest number for each element of two arrays. For example, array1[0] is compared to array2[0] to find the larger number. Runs in linear time - O(n).

### binomialCoeff.c 

Implement the binomial coeffecient formula in C (for nonnegative integers). Runs in constant time - O(1).

	|n|	      n!    
	| |	= ----------
	|k|        k!(n-k)!
